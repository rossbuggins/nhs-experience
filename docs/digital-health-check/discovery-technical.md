# Digital Health Check - Discovery - Technical


## Key Items to address
- Identify possible technical hurdles
- How to ensure DHC discovery/future alpha/beta work is reusable easily
- Any key patterns & practices to follow
- Identify any components of existing system that could be utilised / reused in alpha
- Overview of data model
- GDPR / Data - NHS-E as data controller for PII???? (not technical?)

# Discovery Outcomes Summary

- Component Structure for Alpha - National scalable concerns
- Good UI from previous work
- GP Integration = hard
- Question still to be answered - how can digital improve upon and give more benefit that manual health check - instead of just trying to make a carbon copy of existing process
- Question still to be answered - preloading of data
- Question still to be answered - Data in GP record vs data available to GP - what would GP's want / expect
- Question still to be answered - Invite and cohort management

# DHC Technical Discovery Review

**TODO - Write a summary encompassing all work that has been completed as part of the Technical Discovery**

## Summary

The technical requirements for a Digital Health Check are not novel, or overly complex. A well architected technological implementation should not be a blocker for the progression of this programme.

There are a number of clearly defined boundaries within the overall scope of the programme, that will allow for Agile delivery through incremental and iterative feature development.

- Digital Health Check Library Code
- API for DHC tool
- API for DHC completion
- API for DHC results
- API for invite management
- Authorisation
- End user UI
- Health Care Professional UI
- Pre load service
- Export to GP Service
- Cohorting / Invite Service

Other considerations for beta
- Storage Platform
- Inter service communication / event bus / command handlers etc

Many NHS digital programme requirements start with statements such as "must integrate with NHS App", or " must integrate with NHS.uk". Naive requirements such of this can be appreciated from non technical authors, however architectural and development work should take this and expand to really see the requirement for what it is. Focus on digital solutions should not just be on where they envisaged to be used right now. The NHS App in it's current form will not be around for ever, neither will the nhs web site. Digital solutions MUST be developed with a clear API first focus, that can then be integrated with the NHS app, or any other app.



## Digital Health Check Library Code
At its core, a Digital Health Check is nothing more than:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    In[Data In]
    Process{Process Data}
    Out[Data Out]
    In -->Process
    Process -->Out
```

Event if an alpha achieves nothing more than this process being made available in a open source digital form (whether an API, or  just a code library that can be used in a CLI) the something positive has been achieved that future work can cleanly and easily build upon.

The perceived complexities for a Digital health Check come from where the "Data In" will come from, and where the "Data Out" will go.

At its most basic, it should be a simple idempotent library. 
Note for idempotent methods, thought should be given to not using variable types such as Dates, instead age in days should be used - ensuring that the same data payload always returns the same result, no matter what the date is today.

```csharp
public static HealthCheckResult CalclateHealthCheck(HealthCheckData value)
{
    //Calculate health check and return result.
    throw new NotImplementedException();
}
```

### Incremental Health Check Library Development, Possible Routes
- Start with just basic checks - add more data over time?
- Require all data for a result vs Can give result with partial data?
- Should some be separate libraries / APIs? BMI for example? Blood pressure result?
- 

## Digital Health Check Tool API 
The development of an API first designed system that is just a simple Tool for returning the results of a full set of Health Check data. This will be stateless and can be used by the Digital Health Check Service, both internally and externally. This is a key concept to allowing the DHC work to be reused, and re worked, in the future.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    In(Data In & Out)
    API(API)
    Process{Process Data}
    In <----> API
    API --> Process
```

## Key considerations for all APIs
- Easy data model, including for those who are not Health IT Professionals 
- RESTful
- Asynchronous, use of Location Header
- Clear metric and performance requirements for all API calls
- OAuth claims scoping
- Versioning
- End of Life

## Data Modelling
The tooling APIs should accessible and be intuitive for all to use. I, as a citizen with some technical understanding, should be able to call the Digital Health Check tool API and receive a result.

As such, there must be though given to if a FHIR data model is the best way to go forward for public APIs that are focussed on the Citizen consuming them.

FHIR has a key place in inter health system communication, but it is likely to be perceived as bloated and overly complex for exposing APIs to Citizens.

The DHC API will require .....

## Capacity and Scale Discovery
NEED TO :
- Find out how many health checks per day
- How many NHS Logins
- How much use if only invite vs accessible to all

## Open Source
All development work should be open source from the very start of any beta stage.

## Development Recommendations
- VSCode remote development containers for each project
- Docker build and deploy files
- API first, use swagggerhub for api design and bolilerplate
