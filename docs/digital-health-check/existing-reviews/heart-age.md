[Evaluation of Heart Age Tool](Staffordshire-University-Heart-Age-Test-Evaluation-Report-Final.pdf)

The Heart Age Test (HAT) is an online test to indicate an individual’s potential CVD risk
through estimated Heart Age, which can be compared to their actual age. The test aims to
increase understanding of CVD risk, provide information and signpost individuals to resources
regarding heart health, improve knowledge and understanding of CVD risk, and encourage
individuals to take up the offer of an NHS Health Check (NHSHC).

Assessment of data extracted in 2015 found the test was completed over 500,000 times
(between February and July 2015), with a demographic that broadly resembled the adult
population of England (1). Data suggested the HAT was accessed by some groups not easily
reached through conventional primary care processes (e.g., males and younger adults) and
highlighted users’ limited awareness of their own risk factors (i.e., cholesterol and blood
pressure). Yet it is not known how the test is perceived by users and if the information provided
affects intentions or behaviours to reduce CVD risk.
