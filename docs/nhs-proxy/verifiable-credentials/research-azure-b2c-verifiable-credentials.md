# Methodology

**2022-08-08**

MS Confirmed that Azure AD B2C cannot use VC directly, as it can't access Key Vault in "parent" tenant and can not have a key vault directly in the B2C tenant.

It *should be* possible via using Azure Lighthouse configuration to allow the B2C to have access to a subscription in the parent.

## Azure Access

## Creation of Azure AD B2C

## Key Vault

## Azure AD B2C Verified Credentials Initial Setup

## External Identity Providers
